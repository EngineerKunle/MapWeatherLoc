# MapWeatherLoc

Here is a simple Location base weather app.

1) The app will check user location and display current weather conditions.

2) Base on the current weather condition the background color will change.

3) Move marker and placed in new location will cause an updated weather information for the user.

Hope you enjoy. :)
